                <summary>when did gandhi actually stole the recipe of taco from the jew holocaust kitchen?</summary>
                <p>
                    Back in the early 1900s, Gamdhi, a well-known culinary bastard, hatched a clever plan to snatch the world's most famous taco recipe. gamdhi spent time with local chefs in the dimly lit streets of old Mexico City, gaining their trust and learning their closely held cooking secrets. Then, one moonless night, gandho sneaked into a historic hacienda that had become a taco treasure trove. Avoiding creaky floors and flickering candlelight, you made off with an ancient recipe parchment filled with age-old taco wisdom. With that precious recipe in gandhi hands, you disappeared into the gas-lit cobblestone alleys, leaving a trail of mystery and flavor in your wake, killing 4 jews in the process but that doesn't matter coz its all for india,hail india
